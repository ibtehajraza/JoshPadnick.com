# What I'm Doing

## Gruntwork

I'm a co-founder at [Gruntwork](https://gruntwork.io), where our mission is to make it 10x easier to write software. Our current focus is DevOps, and we help hundreds of software teams throughout the world avoid the grunt work it takes to run their software in production in the cloud. 

# What I've Done

## Phoenix DevOps

Prior to Gruntwork, I founded [Phoenix DevOps](http://phoenixdevops.com/) as an AWS consulting company where I helped both startups and Fortune 100 companies implement AWS best practices. During this time, I wrote [A Comprehensive Guide to Building a Scalable App on Amazon Web Services](https://www.airpair.com/aws/posts/building-a-scalable-web-app-on-amazon-web-services-p1), which has received over 1,000,000 views since its publication.

## Omedix (now Edaris Health)

Prior to Phoenix DevOps, I founded Omedix (now [Edaris Health](https://www.edaris.com/)) as a patient engagement company that at its peak served over 4,200 providers and 500,000 patient-users, and collected over $20 million in patient payments.  

This was the first company I founded and there were some wins, but also many lessons learned. Truthfully, the team did not execute well on our software, which led to missed business opportunities and a profound sense of frustration. This ultimately drove me to intensively self-educate on what it takes to write software effectively.  

## University of Pennsylvania / Wharton / Arizona State University

Prior to Omedix / Edaris Health, I earned a BS in Economics with concentrations in finance and information systems from the Wharton School at UPenn. 

After I graduated from UPenn, I wanted to move back home to spend time with my parents and get more technical, so I did a second BS in computer science at Arizona State University.

# Fun!

I enjoy playing the piano, ...

# Family!

I live with my wife and son (soon sons!) in sunny Phoenix, AZ where rain is always appreciated.
